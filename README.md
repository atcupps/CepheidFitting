This repository contains programs and data for a project fitting Cepheid variable stellar magnitude data and counting the number of bumps in the star's phase plot. `reformatter.py` reformats a list of objects output from the SIMBAD database (in the case of the `.txt` files in the repository, these are Type-I and Type-II Cepheids) as an input query compatible with IRSA multi-object search by RA and Dec. `fitting.py` fits the data by calculating the Fourier series coefficients of the stars' "adjusted magnitude" (magnitude normalized by median value and centered about zero) and then plots it. `fitting.py` requires the `oid` and `period` values to be changed for each star; these can be obtained from IRSA - the period specifically can be found using the IRSA period-finding tool.
